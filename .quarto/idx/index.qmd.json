Column names are inconsistent, containing a mix of capital letter and dots (.).\n2.  The skim() function incorrectly report the dataset as free from missing value (NA).\n3.  Misspelling input in `companylocation` column.\n4.  Bias during data collection stage. Companies are evaluated multiple time in a year\n5.  Rating collection for each manufacturer is not consistent across the years.\n\nData cleaning outcome:\n\nAfter removing row with NA, the sample size reduced from 1795 to 884 which remains acceptable for further analysis. Dropping sample which contains NA to ensure that all the remaining observations come from a completed dataset.\n\n## Data Manipulation\n\n```{r}\n\nflavors_of_cacao_without_na <- \nflavors_of_cacao_without_na %>% \n  mutate( companylocation = case_when(\n          companylocation == \"U.S.A.\" ~ \"United States of America\",\n          companylocation == \"U.K.\" ~ \"United Kingdom\",\n          companylocation == \"Scotland\" ~ \"United Kingdom\",\n          companylocation == \"Amsterdam\" ~ \"Netherlands\",\n          companylocation == \"Sao Tome\" ~ \"São Tomé and Principe\",\n          companylocation == \"Czech Republic\" ~ \"Czechia\",\n          companylocation == \"Eucador\" ~ \"Ecuador\",\n          T ~ companylocation\n        ),\n        beantype = case_when(\n          str_detect(beantype, regex(\"Criollo, Trinitario|Trinitario, Criollo|Trinitario, Forastero|Criollo, +|Amazon, ICS|Blend-Forastero,Criollo|Criollo, Forastero|Amazon mix|Forastero, Trinitario|Trinitario, TCGA|Trinitario, Nacional\" ,ignore_case = T)) ~ \"Blend\",\n          str_detect(beantype, regex(\"Forastero|CCN51|Matina\", ignore_case = T)) ~\"Forastero\",\n          str_detect(beantype, regex(\"criollo\", ignore_case = T)) ~ \"Criollo\",\n          str_detect(beantype, regex(\"Nacional|EET\", ignore_case = T)) ~ \"Nacional\",\n          str_detect(beantype, regex(\"Trinitario\", ignore_case = T)) ~ \"Trinitario\",\n          TRUE ~ beantype \n        ),\n        cocoapercent = as.double(gsub(\"\\\\%\",\"\",cocoapercent))/100\n         )\n\n\n\n```\n\nIn the data manipulation, adjustment is conducted to standardized, categoried and removed noises which potentially misleading the final result. \n\n## First Insight: Overall Rating Distribution\n::: panel-tabset\n### Average Rating Distribution\n```{r}\nbreak_generator(\n  breaks_name = \"score_break\",\n  labels_name = \"score_label\",\n  start = 0,\n  end = 5,\n  gap = 1\n)\n\n\n#overall review on score\nplot_for_rating_distribution<-\nflavors_of_cacao_without_na %>% \n  select(companymakerifknown, rating) %>% \n  group_by(companymakerifknown) %>% \n  \n  #remove duplicated company to avoid flooding specific rating\n  summarise(avg_rating = mean(rating), .groups = \"drop\") %>% \n  mutate(score_group = cut(avg_rating,\n                           breaks = score_break,\n                           labels = score_label,\n                           right = F,\n                             ordered_result = T),\n  score_group = case_when(\n            avg_rating == \"5\" ~ \"4-5\",\n            T ~ score_group\n           )) %>% \n  \n  #evaluate only avrage rating for every company\n  group_by(score_group) %>% \n  summarise(total_count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nbarchart_plotly(\n  database = plot_for_rating_distribution,\n  x_col = score_group,\n  y_col = total_count,\n  fill_col = score_group,\n) %>% layout(\n  title = \"Average Rating Distribution For Chocolate\",\n  xaxis = list(title = \"Score Group\"),\n  yaxis = list(title = \"Count\")\n)\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#Distribution in percentage\nplot_for_rating_distribution %>% \n  ungroup %>% \n  mutate(sum_of_total_count = sum(total_count),\n         percentage = paste0(\n           round((total_count/sum_of_total_count)*100,2),\n           \"%\"\n         )) %>% \n  select(-sum_of_total_count) %>% \n  arrange(score_group) %>% \n  t(.) %>% \n  kbl(caption = \"Rating Distribution in Percentage\") %>% \n  kable_styling()\n  \n```\n\n\nThe bar chart above illustrates the average rating of every company throughout the years.

The bar chart above shows a marked rise in the 3–4 score group over time, followed by the 2–3 score group, which displays a fluctuating trend. The 1–2 and 4–5 score groups appear as extremes: companies in the 1–2 score group improve to remain competitive in the market, while the 4–5 score group is reserved for only the very best chocolate manufacturers. \n\n:::\n## Second Insight: Distribution by Country\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n### Distribution of Chocolate Manufacturer by Country\n\n```{r}\n\nflavors_of_cacao_without_na_group_by_country <- \nflavors_of_cacao_without_na %>% \n  # find average rating per company per year\n  select(companymakerifknown, rating, companylocation) %>% \n  # calculate average rating for company \n  group_by(companymakerifknown, companylocation) %>% \n  summarise(avg_rating = mean(rating), .groups = \"drop\") %>% \n  select(-companymakerifknown) %>% \n  # Distribution Rating and Count to Country\n  group_by(companylocation) %>% \n  summarise(\n    avg_rating = mean(avg_rating),\n    total_count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nggplotly(\n  map_function(\n    database = flavors_of_cacao_without_na_group_by_country,\n    assign_name = worldmap_group_by_number_of_company,\n    joinby = companylocation,\n    fill = total_count)+\n    labs(title = \"global map\")+\n    theme_function()\n)\n\n```\n\nThe map above shows the distribution of chocolate manufacturers across countries.

The Vertical bar chart illustrates the number of chocolate manufacturers by countries and ordered by average rating in descending order, While line chart shows the changes of average rating across the years for each country.\n\nUSA appears as the main chocolate bar manufacturing country, with 118 companies, equivalent to 41.84% of the total manufacturers. The average ratings for USA remains stable in between 3.0 and 3.4 across the years. United Kingdom, the second-largest market player, holds significantly smaller market shares 6.74% (19 manufacturing companies) as compared to USA.\n\n:::\n\n## Third Insight: Relationship of Cacao Bean and Rating\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### Rating Distribution by Type of Cacao Bean\n```{r}\nflavors_of_cacao_without_na_group_by_beantype <- \nflavors_of_cacao_without_na %>% \n  # calculate average rating base on beantype\n  select(companymakerifknown, beantype, rating) %>% \n  group_by(beantype) %>% \n  mutate(average_rating = round(mean(rating),2)) %>% \n  ungroup() %>%\n  # find only unique company with different beantype\n  select(companymakerifknown, beantype, average_rating) %>% \n  distinct() %>% \n  # summarize total number of company with unique beantype \n  group_by(beantype, average_rating) %>% \n  summarise(total_count = n(), .groups = \"drop\") %>% \n  # sort base on lowerest to highest rating\n  arrange(average_rating) %>% \n  mutate(beantype = factor(beantype, levels = beantype))\n\nbean_group <- as.character(unique(flavors_of_cacao_without_na_group_by_beantype$beantype))\n\nreview_for_bean_per_year <-\nflavors_of_cacao_without_na %>% \n  # group by year and company\n  group_by(reviewdate, beantype) %>% \n  summarise(average_rating = mean(rating), .groups = \"drop\") %>% \n  arrange(reviewdate, beantype)\n\nf<- barchart_plotly(\n  database = flavors_of_cacao_without_na_group_by_beantype,\n  x_col = beantype,\n  y_col = total_count,\n  text_col = average_rating,\n  matched_group_col = beantype,\n  ordered_group = bean_group\n)\n\nf2<- scatter_plotlyv2(\n  database = review_for_bean_per_year,\n  x_col = reviewdate,\n  y_col = average_rating,\n  #text_col = average_rating,\n  matched_group_col = beantype,\n  ordered_group = bean_group,\n  display =F\n  #checking = T\n) \n\n \nsubplot(f, f2, shareX = F, shareY = F, nrows =2) %>% \nbutton_generator(\n    ordered_group = bean_group,\n    sec_graph_display = F\n  ) %>%   \n  layout(\n    title = \"Supply of Bean Type with Average Rating\"\n  )\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n\nflavors_of_cacao_without_na_group_by_beantype %>% \n  mutate(sum_of_count = sum(total_count),\n         percentage = paste0(round((total_count/sum_of_count)*100,2),\"%\")) %>% \n  arrange(desc(total_count)) %>% \n  select(-sum_of_count) %>% \n  t(.) %>% \n  kbl(caption = \"Type of Bean with Associate Average Rating\") %>% \n  kable_styling()\n```\n\n\nThe figure above combines a bar chart and a line chart. The bar chart displays the distribution of bean types ordered by average rating, while the line chart shows changes in ratings over the years.\n\nTrinitario, a hybrid of Forastero and Criollo that inherits disease resistance from Forastero and superior flavor from Criollo ([source]([link](https://scienceofchocolate.com/bean-to-bar-blog/are-there-only-three-varieties-of-cacao-which-one-is-best))\n), is the most widely used cocoa in the market, accounting for 42.05% of the total with an average rating of 3.25 across the years.\n\nForastero, the second most commonly used cocoa (24.55% of the market), is favored for its ease of cultivation and high yield ([source](https://radadinternational.com/cocoa-varieties-and-their-unique-flavors-forastero-criollo-trinitario-and-nacional)\n). However, its average rating is lower compared to Trinitario.\n\nCriollo ranks third in usage; although it produces smaller yields, it is valued for its stronger flavor compared to other varieties. Blend (mixed cocoa), Nacional, Amazon, and Beniano varieties serve more niche market segments.\n\n### TSNE Plotting\n```{r}\n\nflavors_of_cacao_without_na %>% \n  select(beantype, cocoapercent, rating) %>% \ntsne_function(\n  database = ., \n  point_to_consider = 100,\n  blur_rate = 0.1,\n  group_col = beantype,\n  show_iteration_msg = F)\n\n\n\n```\n\nThe t-SNE plot above illustrates the relationships among cocoa percentage, rating, and bean type.

Inight suggests that high cocoa percentage do not result in high ratings. Distribution across beantype illustrates highest average rating normally laid in between 60 to 80 cocoa percentage. \n:::\n\n## Preliminary Screening for ANOVA Analysis\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n### Sample Size Assessment\n```{r}\nflavors_of_cacao_without_na %>% \n  group_by(companymakerifknown, beantype) %>% \n  summarise(average_cocoapercent = mean(cocoapercent), .groups = \"drop\") %>% \n  group_by(beantype) %>% \n  summarise(num_of_user = n(), .groups = \"drop\") %>%\n  arrange(num_of_user) %>%\n  save_function(name = \"sample_size_assessment_result\", type = \"NULL\", return = T) %>% \n  kbl(caption = \"sample size for beantype\") %>%\n  kable_styling()\n  \n```\nSample size assessment indicates that Amazon, Beniano, and Nacional have small sample sizes, making them unsuitable for ANOVA testing.\n\n### Visualization and Shapiro Assessment\n```{r}\n\nbean_type <-sample_size_assessment_result$beantype[4:7]\n\nflavors_of_cacao_without_na %>% \n  group_by(companymakerifknown, beantype) %>% \n  summarise(average_rating = mean(rating), .groups = \"drop\") %>% \n  save_function(name =\"sample\", type = \"NULL\", return = T) %>% \nhist_bell_plotly(\n  database = .,\n  x_col = average_rating,\n  bin_size = 0.05,\n  matched_group_col = beantype,\n  ordered_group = bean_type\n) %>% \n  bell_curve_selection_generator(\n    number_of_curve = 8,\n    hist_bell = T\n  ) %>% \n  layout(\n    xaxis = list(title = \"Average Rating\"),\n    yaxis = list(title = \"Density\")\n    \n  )\n\n```\n```{r}\nshapiro_group_testing(\n  database = sample,\n  matched_group_col = beantype,\n  ordered_group = bean_type,\n  x_col = average_rating\n) %>% \n  kbl(caption = \"Result from shapiro test\") %>% \n  kable_styling()\n```\n\nThe Shapiro-Wilk test shows that the remaining groups deviate from normality, as their p-values are ≤ 0.05. Visual inspection of the histograms suggests that larger sample sizes could improve the approximation to normality and increase p-values.\n:::\n\n# Conclusion\n\nTrinitario has the largest market share due to its characteristics—high yield rate and disease resistance inherited from Forastero, combined with superior taste from Criollo. Based on visual inspection, there are no significant differences between bean type and rating, and the ANOVA test could not be performed because the sample sizes by bean type do not follow a normal distribution. Additionally, a higher cocoa percentage does not necessarily result in higher ratings; the optimal cocoa range appears to be between 60% and 80%, suggesting that the best flavors arise from a balanced combination of ingredients rather than solely from cocoa content.\n\nIn terms of manufacturers, 41.84% of companies (118 manufacturers) are from the USA, making it the largest chocolate bar supplier by a significant margin.\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
